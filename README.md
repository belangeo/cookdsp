# cookdsp
DSP library for Reaperâ€™s plugin language JS

The CookDSP library is a set of functions and objects to help the creation of plugins inside the Reaper software with the built-in JS language. JS is a scripting language which is compiled on the fly and allows you to modify and/or generate audio and MIDI processes, as well as draw custom vector based UI and analysis displays.

One must import the file cookdsp.jsfx-inc in the plugin before using any of the functions documented here. Importing a file is very easy with the import keyword:

    import cookdsp.jsfx-inc
